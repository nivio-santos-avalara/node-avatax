# CoffeeScript AvaTax API
Very primitive CoffeeScript-based AvaTax API implementation supporting only GetTax operation, and of that only a limited number of fields. Makes clumsy attempt at basic validation of request fields. Has no dependencies to third-party utilities. Tested and developed under node.js 0.7.9 and CoffeeScript 1.3.3. Uses a static configuration scheme for credentials and API endpoint, see avatax-config.coffee.template.
